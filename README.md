# Fundamento-reactjs-ts

Hello, my name is Gustavo Alessandro. This project uses **JS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and later on **TS**, was added.

**ViteJS** is used so we can create a fast and simple development environment.

Node need package manager and to do so we use **Npm**.

"Fundamentos-reactjs-ts" is used to learn the beginners concepts about react, and ts, such as, jsx, tsx, state, components, props, css modules, events,
rendering, folder structure and other concepts.

# Jsx

Jsx is short for Javascript XML, allows us to write XML in JS, that means HTML transforms in valid JS.

# Tsx

Tsx is similar to Jsx, but uses Typescript instead of Javascript.
