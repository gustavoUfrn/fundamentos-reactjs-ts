# Fundamento-reactjs-ts

Hello, my name is Gustavo Alessandro. This project uses **JS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and later on **TS**, was added.
**ViteJS** is used so we can create a fast and simple development environment.
``` 
npm create vite@latest fundamento-react-js
```
Node need package manager and to do so we use **Npm**.
